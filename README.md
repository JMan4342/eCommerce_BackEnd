## Description

This application demonstrates my ability to create a database for an e-commerce store by utilizing MySQL and Sequelize. The ecommerce database utilizes a category, product, and tag tables to organize the inventory for the e-commerce store.  I am able to create, update, and delete items in each of these tables.
